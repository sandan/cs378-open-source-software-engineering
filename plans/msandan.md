## Status

* Still trying to digest this [issue](https://github.com/geotrellis/curve/issues/3) to get some ideas
* Finishing up the HilbertCurve's RangeQuery implementation in the refactored HilbertCurve2D implementation

## Goal

*space filling curve implementations

*scalable test and benchmark framework  

*flawless documentation, high test coverage, and example use cases 

## Plan

1. Add benchmarks for existing SFC's
2. Add tests for existing SFC's
1. Add to the conversation in this [issue](https://github.com/geotrellis/curve/issues/3)
1. Implement SpaceFillingCurve3D trait
2. Implement the RangeQuery in the refactored HilbertCurve2D impl
